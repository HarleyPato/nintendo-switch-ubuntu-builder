# bash 4.4.18-1ubuntu1osrf1

In order to build arm images while working through [#18][] I've packaged bash built with -no-pie (as Debian has done to fix the bug).

This branch only exists to upload release assets against it.

[#18]: https://github.com/osrf/multiarch-docker-image-generation/issues/18
